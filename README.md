# Fire, Smoke, and Abandoned Object Detection System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a robust computer vision system capable of detecting fire, smoke, and abandoned objects in real-time video feeds. The system can be deployed in various environments such as public spaces, industrial facilities, or surveillance networks to enhance safety and security.

### Key Features

- **Fire Detection**: Identifies flames or fire in real-time using advanced image processing and deep learning techniques.
- **Smoke Detection**: Detects the presence of smoke, which can be an early indicator of fire or other hazardous situations.
- **Abandoned Object Detection**: Monitors areas for objects that have been left unattended for a specified period, helping to prevent security threats.
